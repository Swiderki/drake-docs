## Our Features

DrakeEngine is built with a focus on powerful, flexible, and intuitive game development. Here are some of the core features that make DrakeEngine stand out:

- **Quaternion and Projection Matrix Usage**: At the heart of our 3D transformations, we leverage quaternions and projection matrices to ensure smooth and realistic rotations and perspectives.

- **OBJ Model Loading**: Import your 3D models seamlessly with our OBJ file loader, making it easy to bring your detailed creations into the game environment.

- **Consistent Physics Concept**: Dive into game development with a robust and coherent physics system that adds realism and dynamic interactions to your game world.

- **Custom GUI Creation on Canvas**: Enhance player experience by designing and implementing your own GUI directly onto the game's canvas, providing intuitive and stylish interfaces.
